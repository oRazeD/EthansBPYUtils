# razeds_bpy_utils
razeds_bpy_utils is an incredibly loose collection of refined BPY-based functions and classes that perform; in most cases, frequently used operations. Some files such as materials.py are scraped directly from other add-ons and as such aren't currently usable in any capacity and only exist as an inlet for future ideas. This library will mainly be updated as I develop my other existing add-ons serving as a functionality bridge between them. razeds_bpy_utils also comes with some example scripts that I've scraped from around online. You are welcome to use any of the code in this repo however you so wish under GPL licensing.

## How do I use this library?
razeds_bpy_utils is not loaded with PIP or anything like that, but you can either add this library as a [Git Submodule](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to your own repo or just manually download the files. If using the Git Submodule method, simply update the pointers to recieve updates from this repo as they are committed.

## What do you use for Blender Add-on Development?
My IDE of choice is Visual Studio Code with the Blender Development plugin for efficiently testing changes and fake_bpy_module for proper syntax highlighting.
