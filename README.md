# razeds_bpy_utils

razeds_bpy_utils is an incredibly loose collection of refined BPY-based functions and classes that perform; in most cases, frequently used operations. Some files such as materials.py are scraped directly from other add-ons and as such aren't currently usable in any capacity and only exist as an inlet for future ideas. This library will mainly be updated as I develop my other existing add-ons serving as a functionality bridge between them. razeds_bpy_utils also comes with some example scripts that I've scraped from around online. You are welcome to use any of the code in this repo however you so wish under GPL licensing.

HOW TO USE: razeds_bpy_utils is not loaded with PIP or anything like that, but you can add this library as a Git Submodule to your existing Git Repositories. Simply update the pointers to recieve updates from this repo as they are committed.

As far as utilities not specifically included in this repository, I will update this README to include any resources I find that I'd like to personally come back to or share with you:
